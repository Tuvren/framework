# Tuvren

Tuvren is a durable, stateful agent-execution framework, built polyglot by
construction: language-neutral authority under `spec/` (authority packets,
CDDL/TypeSpec contracts, and conformance plans) defines cross-language
semantics once, and each language implementation is certified against
that same authority rather than against another language's source. The
kernel — durable turn/thread/branch state, deterministic hashing, backend
capabilities — is the substrate this durability guarantee is built on;
"Kraken" is the engine-internal name for that substrate and never appears
in consumer-facing APIs.

## Repo map

- `spec/` — language-neutral authority: authority packets, CDDL/TypeSpec
  contracts, generated artifacts, and conformance plans/fixtures per port
  (`kernel`, `core`, `providers`, `tools`, `runners`, `streaming`, `host`,
  `telemetry`, `interop`, `extensions`).
- `typescript/` — the TypeScript reference implementation: kernel,
  runtime, providers, runners, streaming, tools/drivers, telemetry, and
  the host REPL, plus each boundary's conformance adapters and
  certification wrappers.
- `rust/` — the Rust implementation line, currently the framework's
  second language: the kernel (`rust/kernel`), its gRPC service
  (`rust/kernel-grpc-service`), and both the kernel-specific and generic
  framework conformance adapter/certification pairs
  (`rust/kernel-conformance-adapter` + `rust/kernel-certification`,
  `rust/conformance-adapter` + `rust/certification`).
- `tools/` — shared, language-neutral tooling: the semantic conformance
  engine (`tools/conformance/harness/run.ts`), the adapter protocol,
  certification discovery, codegen/validation scripts, and generators.
- `docs/` — human-authored specifications
  (`KrakenKernelSpecification.md`, `KrakenFrameworkSpecification.md`) and
  contributor guides (`docs/guides/`).

## Quickstart

```sh
# 1. Load the repo toolchain (bun, cargo, bazel, buf, weaver, postgres — via Nix/devenv)
direnv allow   # or: eval "$(devenv direnvrc)" && use devenv

# 2. Install workspace dependencies
bun install

# 3. Fast inner-loop check (authority gates + affected typecheck/test/lint)
bun run check

# 4. Start devenv-managed services once per session (Postgres, for kernel/verify lanes)
bun run services:up

# 5. Full release gate
bun run verify
```

Narrower lanes exist for iterating on the kernel boundary specifically:
`bun run verify:kernel` (cached) and `bun run verify:kernel:fresh`
(forced through uncached Nx targets).

## The certification model

Cross-language truth lives in committed, machine-readable authority under
`spec/` — authority packets and conformance plans — never in Markdown or
in any one implementation's source. Certification is discovery-driven:
every Nx project tagged `layer:certification` is discovered automatically
and cross-checked against a manifest
(`tools/conformance/certification/certified-projects.json`) by a hard-fail
parity gate, so a certification runner can't silently disappear or go
unregistered. Each certified project wraps a language-specific
conformance adapter — a protocol-only process that never grades its own
output — and the shared semantic engine
(`tools/conformance/harness/run.ts`) evaluates that adapter's behavior
against the authority-defined conformance plan, so every implementation
of a given port is judged against the same neutral checks.
